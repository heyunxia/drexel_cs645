In this problem, we will explore why it's never a good idea to reuse your one-time pads. I’ve provided six messages encrypted with three one-time pads (available on the course website).

This project is due on August 14.

The problem has three parts, each worth equal points.

1. Discuss your approach to solving this problem. Consider the ASCII encoding system, the mathematical properties of exclusive-or, predictability of human and computer languages, and any other factors that will help you solve this problem.

2. Determine which pairs of ciphertext were encrypted using the same ``one-time'' pads.

// BEGIN ANSWER 2

Presumed matches:

./xOr.py 'the' 'and' suggests ct3 and ct1 match
./xOr.py ');' 'and' suggests ct4 and ct6 match
By process of elimination, the remaining two texts match

// END ANSWER 2

3. Report the six plaintexts. 
Hints:
• Each pad was used exactly twice. 
• One of the messages is code, one of the messages is song lyrics, and one of the messages is a Shakespeare quotation. The other three are other memorable phrases.
