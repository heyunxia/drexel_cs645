In this problem, we will explore why it's never a good idea to reuse
your one-time pads. I’ve provided six messages encrypted with three
one-time pads (available on the course website).

This project is due on August 14.

The problem has three parts, each worth equal points.

1. Discuss your approach to solving this problem. Consider the ASCII
encoding system, the mathematical properties of exclusive-or,
predictability of human and computer languages, and any other factors
that will help you solve this problem.

2. Determine which pairs of ciphertext were encrypted using the same
``one-time'' pads.

// BEGIN ANSWER 2

ct2.hex & ct5.hex
ct1.hex & ct3.hex
ct4.hex & ct6.hes

// END ANSWER 2

3. Report the six plaintexts.  Hints: • Each pad was used exactly
twice.  • One of the messages is code, one of the messages is song
lyrics, and one of the messages is a Shakespeare quotation. The other
three are other memorable phrases.

ct2.hex or ct5.hex:
-------------------

Listen - Do you want to know a secret? Do you promise not to tell? whoa oh, oh Closer - Let me whisper in your ear -The Beatles

I never teach my pupils. . .I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn. -Albert Einstein

(it's padded with spaces at the end)

ct1.hex or ct3.hex:
-------------------

Make amazing mistakes, make glorious and fantastic mistakes. Break rules. Leave the world more interesting for your being here -Neil Gaiman

Let every eye negotiate for itself -William Shakespeare

TODO JOE: These aren't the exact quotes. Find the exact quotes before submissio (These are very close though) with right spaces, etc.

ct4.hex or ct6.hex:
-------------------
C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do, it blows away your whole leg.  -Stroustrup

{int cookie;char buf[80];printf("buf: %08x cookie: %08x\n", &buf, &cookie);gets(buf);if (cookie == 0x41424344) printf("win!");}
